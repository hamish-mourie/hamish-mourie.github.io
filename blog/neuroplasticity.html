            <h3 class="center-text">Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p class="bold-text">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people:</p>
            <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity boost peoples’ capabilities in learning. By changing a behaviour peoples’ brain cells change in response to that. By frequently engaging in that behaviour the connections between the brain cells are physically strengthened.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit:</p>
            <p>Reminding myself that my capabilities are malleable through the means of continuous and gradual behavioural actions.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?:</p>
            <p>I can select an activity to undertake that is new, challenging and important to me. I can enhance my ability in programming by tapping into my existing neural pathways. By prioritising activities which are already routine (such as gaming) I can integrate aspects of programming into them to enhance my neuroplasticity.</p>

            <h3 class="center-text">Growth Mindset</h3>
            <p class="bold-text">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant:</p>
            <p>A growth mindset refers to the belief that talents can be developed through hard work, good strategies, and continuous practice. A fixed mindset on the other hand refers to the belief that talents are innate and cannot be improved.
              Having a growth mindset is relevant because it creates opportunities to learn, gain new skills, and enhance existing skills.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?:</p>
            <p>No, I’m familiar with this concept as whilst studying for my degree in psychology it came up. I already hold the belief that if I haven’t learnt something it’s only because I haven’t attempted to do so.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?:</p>
            <p>Even if something looks incredibly complex at first glance it can be broken down into smaller components and eventually be achieved over a long period of time and effort.</p>
