          <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
          <p>
            My long term goal is to work in IT due to the possibility of working remotely. After obtaining several years of experience a career working as a full-stack developer appeals to me. I hope to use the skills gained from Dev Academy to be able to develop web applications.
          </p>
          <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
          <p>
            My strengths and limitations mentioned below are still valid. For bootcamp I think my biggest strength will be the ability to meet deadlines and expectations, as I dedicate extra time to things to ensure that they get finished to a standard I’m proud of. I think that the biggest limitation I’ll face during bootcamp is the tendency to not reach out to others to find out how they’re going with things.
          </p>
          <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
          <p>
            The biggest non-technical challenge I’ll face for bootcamp initially will be the 8.30am-5.30pm schedule, as I normally do work in the afternoon until late. I think I’ll also find it a challenge to be constantly present in video calls, as I’m accustomed to working independently.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column box-default box-shader-2">
          <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
          <p>
            I’d like to develop the mindset to work on projects which go beyond just deadlines and expectations (as in, attempting stretch activities which go beyond what’s expected).
          </p>
          <p>
            I’d also like to develop the ability to reach out to others to find out how they’re progressing with the course.
          </p>
          <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
          <p>
            To respond to reasonable student enquiries to the best of their abilities during standard working hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            In regards to technical aspects of the course I currently have the expectation that learning will be more teacher driven, rather than independently driven like it was in foundations.
          </p>
          <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
          <p>
            My personal expectation is that I'll be online actively learning during 8.30am-5.30pm, Monday-Friday; and if needed an additional 2 hours at night could be spent solidifying learning content. I will seek help firstly from my peers, then secondly from the bootcamp team. I’ll seek help if stuck on a single problem for more than 30 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            To work with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives I will apply skills which are conducive to productive and safe communication which follow core values relating to diversity, empathy, wellbeing, and trust.

          <h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</h4>
          <p>Strengths: When others are reliant upon me learning something, then I will ensure that I understand/complete the learning content.</p>
          <p>Limitations: Without deadlines or others’ expectations I often don’t engage with learning content in a timely manner.</p>
          <h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
          <p>I’d like to develop the ability to reach out to others.</p>

          <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h4>
          <p>If I cannot work something out myself within 30 minutes then I will seek help from my peers. If my peers cannot help me within a few hours then I will get help from a Dev Academy facilitator.</p>
          <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:</h4>
          <p>To respond to reasonable student enquiries to the best of their abilities during standard working hours.</p>
          <h4>Any scheduling information:</h4>
          <p>I have no scheduled commitments to others that would impact my learning at Dev Academy.</p>

          <h4 class="center-text">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:</h4>
          <p>To work productively I’ll set goals at the start of every day and manage my time appropriately.</p>
          <p>To work productively and safely with others involved in the Dev Academy programme I’ll aim to implement actions and behaviours that align with the core values of integrity, kindness and effort.</p>
          <p>When the workload builds up and starts getting to me I’ll take a step back and look at the bigger picture. When looking at the bigger picture I can often see that a few things have been taking up my attention for too long, and that I should move on to the next thing to continue progressing.</p>
