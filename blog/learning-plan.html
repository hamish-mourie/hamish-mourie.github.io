            <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
            <p>To work as a full-stack developer.</p>
            <h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</h4>
            <p>Strengths: When others are reliant upon me learning something, then I will ensure that I understand/complete the learning content.</p>
            <p>Limitations: Without deadlines or others’ expectations I often don’t engage with learning content in a timely manner.</p>
            <h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
            <p>I’d like to develop the ability to reach out to others.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column box-default box-shader-2">
            <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h4>
            <p>If I cannot work something out myself within 30 minutes then I will seek help from my peers. If my peers cannot help me within a few hours then I will get help from a Dev Academy facilitator.</p>
            <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:</h4>
            <p>To respond to reasonable student enquiries to the best of their abilities during standard working hours.</p>
            <h4>Any scheduling information:</h4>
            <p>I have no scheduled commitments to others that would impact my learning at Dev Academy.</p>

          <div class="column box-default box-shader-3">
            <h4 class="center-text">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:</h4>
            <p>To work productively I’ll set goals at the start of every day and manage my time appropriately.</p>
            <p>To work productively and safely with others involved in the Dev Academy programme I’ll aim to implement actions and behaviours that align with the core values of integrity, kindness and effort.</p>
            <p>When the workload builds up and starts getting to me I’ll take a step back and look at the bigger picture. When looking at the bigger picture I can often see that a few things have been taking up my attention for too long, and that I should move on to the next thing to continue progressing.</p>
