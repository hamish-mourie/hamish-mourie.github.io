            <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. <br> Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action:</h3>
            <p>An ethical decision I’ve made in the past is valuing clients’ needs over personal monetary gain - specifically when providing IT assistance and not billing for the time spent resolving issues.</p>
            <p>The values involved in that decision were responsibility and empathising. When another person relies upon me for a task I value the responsibility that it brings, I always seek to carry out the things that I commit to if it affects another person.
              When someone has a different experience from myself I often take on board how they feel and react accordingly.</p>
            <p>The consequence of helping others without receiving personal monetary gain is rewarding as it makes your skills feel more valued when there isn’t the expectation that you’re only helping them because it’s your job.</p>

            <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development:</h3>
            <p>In my learning and career development my strengths are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Committing to the responsibilities I’ve taken on</li>
              <li>Planning everything out in detail before diving into anything</li>
              <li>Applying methods which have been proven to work for others in the past</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My limitations are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Lack of experience working in a team environment</li>
              <li>Feeling uncomfortable reaching out to others, as I haven’t previously been in an environment conducive to situations where this is required</li>
              <li>Seeking to minimise stress - which results in a lack of asking for further responsibilities</li>

            <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity:</h3>
            <p>My culture (millennial, Wellingtonian) has influenced my values and identity, as I’ve realised that personal wellbeing/security/independence is more important to me than doing what’s been traditionally done in the past by previous generations (e.g. work long hours in a stressful, unenjoyable job - in return for monetary gain).

            <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles:</h3>
            <p>I feel confident that I will be able to overcome learning obstacles, as when I applied to take on the responsibility of this course I was aware of what would be entailed.<br>My strength of committing to the responsibilities I’ve taken on will see me complete this learning journey with Dev Academy.</p>

            <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.<br>Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why:</h3>
            <p>Earlier this year I worked on a collaborative group report with 2 other people, in which there was tension with another person in the group. This tension involved two differing viewpoints, in which one viewpoint was concerned about everyone participating in the report; versus another viewpoint which was concerned about producing the best report possible regardless of participation levels.</p>
            <p>By applying a strategy of compromise the needs of the report and the needs of every member to feel that they were able to contribute to the report were met.</p>
            <p>This strategy of compromise was effective at producing good outcomes, however another strategy I would use now to resolve a similar experience would be to offer a team member extensive help to enable them to contribute so that they can feel that their contributions are valuable.</p>
