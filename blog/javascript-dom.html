            <p>The three main languages used to build websites are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            HTML is a markup language which uses tags to define elements within a document.
            CSS is used to style HTML documents.
            JavaScript is the programming language used to allow for interaction with HTML elements and CSS styles.</p>
            <p>Here's an analogy for these three languages:</p>
            <p>Let's say for example you get terribly seasick whilst on the Interislander Cook Strait Ferry, so you need to find another solution to travel between the North and South Island.
            The solution is build a 100km bridge between Wellington and Picton!</p>
            <p>With your trillion dollar fortune you get the bridge built in a couple days, its super ugly though. This current structure can be thought of as your HTML.
            After spending your fortune on the bridge you could cross it now, but there's no median lines, rumble strips, barriers or signage. Simply put it's not user friendly at all.</p>
            <p>To spruce up your bridge a bit you overthrow the government of New Zealand in a coup to reallocate public funds towards your project.
            After a couple decades you get the bridge to pass health and safety checks, have pretty colored road lines, and have signs that point to stuff. The bridge is now user friendly. This current structure can be thought of as your HTML & CSS.</p>
            <p>The year is now 2050 and cool people like yourself don't drive cars anymore, they teleport. Time to cash in on all the car drivers still using your bridge!
            You install toll booths throughout the bridge and hire DroneBot3000 enforcement officers to react to driver behaviour.
            Drivers that do not pay are instantly vaporised by your DroneBot3000 army, whereas drivers that frequently use the bridge are rewarded with discounts.
            The bridge now reacts to driver/road user input! This current structure can be thought of as your HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.</p>
