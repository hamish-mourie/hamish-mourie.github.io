            <h4 class="center-text">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
            <p>The capacity to recognise, manage, and assess emotions is referred to as emotional intelligence.</p>
            <p>There are five key EQ skills, being self-awareness, self-regulation, social skills, empathy, and motivation.</p>
            <p>Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your own emotions, and its effect on the moods and emotions of other people.</p>
            <p>Self-regulation is the ability to regulate and manage your emotions, and express them appropriately.</p>
            <p>People with great social skills are better able to form lasting bonds with others and have a deeper knowledge of both themselves and other people.</p>
            <p>Empathy is the ability to understand how others are feeling. It also involves giving responses to people based on this information. This is important for guiding interactions with the different people encountered each day.</p>
            <p>Motivation in an EQ sense refers to self-motivation which is the desire to grow and succeed on a personal level, together with dedication to objectives, initiative, being ready to seize chances, optimism, and resilience.</p>

            <h4>How is EQ different from IQ?</h4>
            <p>Intelligence Quotient measures cognitive abilities such as the ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas.</p>
            <p>Emotional intelligence on the other hand measures abilities to recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column box-default box-shader-3">
            <h4>Why is EQ important?</h4>
            <p>A high EQ is important as it helps to build relationships, reduce team stress, defuse conflict and improve job satisfaction.</p>
