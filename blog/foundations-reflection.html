          <ol>
            <li>Previously I thought I wanted to do front-end web dev, however Iâ€™ve since realised that full-stack web dev would be a much better fit for me.</li>
            <li>In regards to helping ego: I've learnt that when taking on a new IT role most devs aren't familar with all of the technologies that their employer uses. Instead of being productive immediately, the first few weeks/months are just getting up to speed with how things are done in the organisation.</li>
            <li>I've learnt that I highly value feedback. I felt a bit lost without receiving grades/feedback.</li>
          </ol>

        <div class="column box-default box-shader-5">
          <h3 class="center-text">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          <p>
            When programming in a team environment it's important to have values that align with workforces that value diversity, empathy, wellbeing, and trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Empathy is the ability to understand how others are feeling. It also involves giving responses to people based on this information. This is important for guiding interactions with the different people encountered each day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your own emotions, and its effect on the moods and emotions of other people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self-awareness and empathy can be used to guide beneficial decisions when interacting with others.

          <h3 class="center-text">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            What surprised me the most about learning core is that I already knew pretty much everything touched upon in the curriculum, this is because I studied Psychology at Vic uni.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column box-default box-shader-4">
          <h3 class="center-text">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            The most challenging question of core learning was "Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity?". I'd never in the past reflected upon what my culture was. I found that I mainly identified with generational cultural values.
          </p>

        <div class="column box-default box-shader-1">
          <h3 class="center-text">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
          <p>
            Employers look beyond just technical skills, as core skills are important too. By focussing on core skills it gives the Dev Academy business and its students a unique selling point. If the learning focus was to be solely put into tech, then Dev Academy graduates would not be able to compete with others in the job market who have completed multi-year comp-sci degrees.

          <h3 class="center-text">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
          <p>
            For me personally, yes; however for most people the answer would probably be no. Having completed a Bachelors degree in Psychology, and previously studied concepts such as EQ, neuroplasticity, growth mindset, and personal values, the majority of the core skills are just revision for me. My time in foundations would probably have been better spent on stretch coding challenges.
