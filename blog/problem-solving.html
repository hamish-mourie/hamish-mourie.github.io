            <p>
              The simple problem was that a for loop was returning 'undefined' in the FizzBuzz Kata.
            </p>
            <p>
              To solve this issue I used the rubber ducky method as a problem solving technique. By explaining the 2nd parameter of the for loop out loud I found that the loop was running one more time than intended. This occurred because the .length method returns a number which is 1 greater than the final array index number (as array indexes are counted from 0).
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the process of solving this problem I was initially confused because the error message which was provided didn't help much.
              After finding the issue it felt good to know that by looping one less time the issue would be fixed, as it was a simple resolution to implement.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learnt that by sequentially going through the code from start to finish most issues can be found.

            <h3 class="center-text">Elegant Problem Solving</h3>
            <p>
              The FizzBuzz problem was solved elegantly by ordering the number checks in an order so which each "If" check had few conditions. For example the check for if a number was divisible by both 3 AND 5 was done first so that the later "else if" statements only had to check for if one number was divisible/indivisible.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem solving technique used was Googling. Before even knowing about the FizzBuzz challenge being a part of the Dev Academy curriculum I watched a video on YouTube about solving FizzBuzz.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the process it felt good to have set console output objectives.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learnt that there are many ways to solve the same problem. Some ways are done in less lines of code, but are also less modular and less human readable.
